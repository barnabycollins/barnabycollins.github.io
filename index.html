                    I'm currently in my third year studying an MEng Computer Science degree at Durham University.
                    Outside my degree, I love participating in my university's rich music scene, playing ultimate
                    frisbee for my college and working on personal projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One such personal project was <a href="https://rewindrl.github.io">Rewind Gaming</a>, a
                    grassroots organisation running tournaments for the popular game
                    <a href="https://rocketleague.com">Rocket League</a>. I co-founded Rewind Gaming with my school
                    friend <a href="https://bensilverman.co.uk">Ben Silverman</a> in 2016 and continued to manage it
                    with him until its eventual closure due to lack of momentum in the scene in late 2019. During
                    that time, we gave out over $16,000 in sponsored prize pools and played an instrumental part in
                    spearheading the European Rocket League scene. I was primarily responsible for the more technical
                    side of operations, including heading up the development and broadcasting teams and designing
                    polished motion graphics for web broadcasts. This also involved taking a high-level managerial
                    role, including negotiating sponsorships and partnerships with other organisations and larger
                    companies, including Psyonix (the game's developer) and Rival Esports (a similar organisation
                    based in North America).
                    More recently, I have been able to return to the scene, and have worked both as a volunteer and
                    as a freelance broadcast engineer for organisations and streamers including
                    <a href="https://rocketcorerl.com/">Rocket Core</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCldqb1GljWZzaRVtYXfvlAg">Johnnyboi_i</a>.
