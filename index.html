                    My name's Barnaby Collins, and I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at Durham University.
                    Outside my course, I participate in a wide range of groups and fill administrative roles in
                    several executive committees. I have a wide range of interests and skills, mostly focussed
                    around music and live events.

                    it be for now.

                    <p>
                        I originally developed this script for Rewind Gaming as an in-house solution to reduce
                        broadcasters' workload by allowing a remote moderator to keep on-screen information up
                        to date. It runs inside an HTML overlay on the broadcast host computer and automatically
                        updates broadcast graphics with data from the Google Sheets API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was open-sourced upon Rewind Gaming's closure and is now in regular use by a range of
                        entities across the Rocket League scene - notably including popular streamer
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyBoi_i">JohnnyBoi_i</a>, who uses it as
                        a backend for all tournament streams. The idea of using Google Sheets as a remote data
                        source also sparked a number of similar projects from others - such as
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GrandyB93">Grandy</a>'s
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GrandyB/SheetsIO">SheetsIO</a>.

                        During my course, I was part of a 6-person group working on a project for the local foodbank.
                        An existing inventory management system had been designed in Excel VBA, but this had a
                        wide range of shortcomings including lack of scalability, poor user experience and extreme
                        difficulty of maintenance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We designed a web application to replace it, named TrayMaster and written in React
                        TypeScript. To support development, we used an agile development methodology with JetBrains
                        WebStorm as our chosen IDE, GitHub for source control, Heroku for hosting and Firebase for
                        storage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all worked on the full stack, but my particular focus was on designing the UI to be
                        intuitive, functional, responsive, clean, flexible, consistent and attractive. This was
                        a particular challenge as the program was to be used as a Progressive Web App by untrained
                        volunteers on dated Android tablets and the warehouse's structure varied between different
                        areas.

                    <p>
                        During my second year, I developed a website for Durham DJ Society, designed to provide a
                        central destination for information on the society. It originally featured information
                        about the society itself and profiles for society members who were looking for work, but
                        when I joined the executive committee I was able to give it more time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A central part of our plans was to give the society a more slick appearance, so we began
                        by rebranding it and giving the website a corresponding facelift. I also added a more detailed
                        '<a target="_blank" href="https://ddjs.uk/about">About</a>' page with information on the
                        society's mission and executive committee, designed and documented some HTML stream widgets
                        for members to use on their livestreams during the COVID-19 era, obtained a new domain name
                        and set up an email system for the executive committee using Migadu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The DJ profiles in particular have been designed to be easy to update, so they have been put
                        into a JS structure that is used to generate the page. Corresponding documentation is also
                        available on the <a href="https://github.com/DurhamDJ/DurhamDJ.github.io">GitHub
                        repository</a> to ensure that future executive committee members are able to keep using it.

                    <p>
                        Taking place in summer 2018, the Colosseum was Rewind Gaming's first major tournament. On the
                        team preparing for the event, I initially took responsibility for motion graphics and took
                        charge of broadcasting alongside our other broadcaster,
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Bntsw">bntsw.</a>, who I had
                        previously trained.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I designed all moving graphics on the stream's overlay, including the transitions and
                        occasional popups - predominantly animating static work from our graphic designers to produce
                        attractive and professional content to raise the broadcast's production value. A series of
                        these transitions can be found in the minute following
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/JtxqjWJkfVU?t=15197">this point</a> in the recorded
                        livestream of the finals, which I also produced on the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had tasked a member of the development team with writing a broadcast backend in
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nodecg.dev/">NodeCG</a>, but did not hear from him after
                        some time, so I had the idea of using Google Sheets as a database and connecting with its API to
                        update the overlays. Due to the short notice, I had to write the script and integrate it into
                        our HTML overlays within a few days before they were needed. This was the first version of the
                        Updater.js script mentioned <a href="#projects">above</a>, worked flawlessly, and paved the way
                        for a range of other organisations who use the same methods to this day.

                        During the summer of 2020, with most members in lockdown, we at DDJS organised a 10-hour
                        livestream to showcase their talents and provide a focus for their efforts. I took charge of
                        this as the most experienced exec member, and made the decision to host an RTMP server on the
                        broadcast computer such that it consumed performers' audio and video streams and was able to
                        compose them in a central broadcast. This method allowed us to maximise continuity between
                        performers and make use of break screens between sets instead of forcing the audience to open
                        a new stream for each set.

                        I designed the graphics in collaboration with the president, Jake Roberts, organised the
                        streaming and performer logistics, produced several transitions and animations and created a
                        custom onscreen chat box by injecting custom CSS into the Mixcloud popout chat page. I also
                        produced the livestream on the day and contributed my own hour-long set later in the evening.
