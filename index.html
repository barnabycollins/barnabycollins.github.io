                    My name's Barnaby Collins, and I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at Durham University.
                    Outside my course, I participate in a wide range of groups and fill administrative roles in
                    several executive committees. I have a wide range of interests and skills, mostly focussed
                    around music and live events.

                    There will be more text here eventually, and it'll be more coherently written too, but this how
                    it be for now.

                    <p>
                        I originally developed this script for Rewind Gaming as an in-house solution to reduce
                        broadcasters' workload by allowing a remote moderator to keep on-screen information up
                        to date. It runs inside an HTML overlay on the broadcast host computer and automatically
                        updates broadcast graphics with data from the Google Sheets API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was open-sourced upon Rewind Gaming's closure and is now in regular use by a range of
                        entities across the Rocket League scene - notably including popular streamer
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyBoi_i">JohnnyBoi_i</a>, who uses it as
                        a backend for all tournament streams. The idea of using Google Sheets as a remote data
                        source also sparked a number of similar projects from others - such as
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GrandyB93">Grandy</a>'s
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GrandyB/SheetsIO">SheetsIO</a>.

                        During my course, I was part of a 6-person group working on a project for the local foodbank.
                        An existing <a href="https://barnabycollins.github.io/">inventory</a> management system had been designed in Excel VBA, but this had a
                        wide range of shortcomings including lack of scalability, poor user experience and extreme
                        difficulty of maintenance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We designed a web application to replace it, named TrayMaster and written in React
                        TypeScript. To support development, we used an agile development methodology with JetBrains
                        WebStorm as our chosen IDE, GitHub for source control, Heroku for hosting and Firebase for
                        storage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all worked on the full stack, but my particular focus was on designing the UI to be
                        intuitive, functional, responsive, clean, consistent and attractive. This was a particular
                        challenge as the program was to be used as a Progressive Web App by untrained volunteers
                        on dated Android tablets.

                        During my second year, I developed a website for Durham DJ Society, designed to provide a
                        central destination for information on the society. It originally featured information
                        about the society itself and profiles for society members who were looking for work, but
                        when I joined the executive committee I was able to give it more time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A central part of our plans was to give the society a more slick appearance, so we began
                        by rebranding it and giving the website a corresponding facelift. I also added a more detailed
                        '<a target="_blank" href="https://ddjs.uk">About</a>' page with information on the society's
                        mission and executive committee, designed and documented some HTML stream widgets for
                        members to use on their livestreams during the COVID-19 era, obtained a new domain name and
                        set up an email system for the executive committee using Migadu.
